                <h2>The Story Behind </h2>
                <h2> the Rubik's Cube</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Back in 1974, a Hungarian architect and design professor named <strong>Ernő Rubik</strong> was trying
                    to
                    find a fun way to help his students understand how objects move in three dimensions. He wanted
                    something
                    that
                    could show how parts of a structure could shift and rotate without breaking apart. To test the idea,
                    he
                    built a small wooden cube held together with rubber bands and clips—simple, but clever enough to
                    make
                    history.</p>

                <p>At first, Rubik didn't realize he'd invented a puzzle. He just thought it was a neat teaching tool.
                    But
                    when he scrambled the cube and tried to put it back the way it was, he discovered how tough—and
                    addictive—it
                    could be. It actually took him about a month to solve it himself, and that's when he realized he'd
                    created
                    something much more than a classroom model.</p>

                <p>Rubik patented his creation in 1975 under the name “Magic Cube,” or <em>Bűvös Kocka</em> in
                    Hungarian. It
                    started to gain attention around Budapest, but the real breakthrough came a few years later when a
                    Hungarian
                    toy company teamed up with Ideal Toy Corp in the U.S. to produce it for the world market. They
                    renamed
                    it
                    the <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong>, and by 1980 it was flying off store shelves everywhere.</p>

                <p>The cube became an instant global craze. People of all ages were hooked, trying to twist it back to
                    its
                    solved state. It wasn't just a toy—it became a symbol of problem-solving, creativity, and patience.
                    By
                    the
                    early '80s, speedcubing competitions and solving guides started popping up, turning the cube into a
                    worldwide phenomenon that still hasn't faded.</p>


                <p>Today, Ernő Rubik's invention is more than just a nostalgic puzzle—it's a lasting reminder of how
                    curiosity
                    and creativity can lead to something extraordinary. What started as a small experiment for design
                    students
                    has become one of the most recognizable and beloved puzzles on the planet.</p>
